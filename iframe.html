    <h2>The Wizard of Oz</h2>
    <p>All this time Dorothy and her companions had been walking through the thick woods.  The road was still paved with yellow brick, but these were much covered by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees, and the walking was not at all good.</p>
    <p>There were few birds in this part of the forest, for birds love the open country where there is plenty of sunshine.  But now and then there came a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees.  These sounds made the little girl's heart beat fast, for she did not know what made them; but Toto knew, and he walked close to Dorothy's side, and did not even bark in return.</p>
    <p>"How long will it be," the child asked of the Tin Woodman, "before we are out of the forest?"</p>
    <p>"I cannot tell," was the answer, "for I have never been to the Emerald City.  But my father went there once, when I was a boy, and he said it was a long journey through a dangerous country, although nearer to the city where Oz dwells the country is beautiful.  But I am not afraid so long as I have my oil-can, and nothing can hurt the Scarecrow, while you bear upon your forehead the mark of the Good Witch's kiss, and that will protect you from harm."</p>
    <p>"But Toto!" said the girl anxiously.  "What will protect him?"</p>
    <p>"We must protect him ourselves if he is in danger," replied the Tin Woodman.</p>
    <p>Just as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar, and the next moment a great Lion bounded into the road.  With one blow of his paw he sent the Scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the road, and then he struck at the Tin Woodman with his sharp claws.  But, to the Lion's surprise, he could make no impression on the tin, although the Woodman fell over in the road and lay still.</p>
    <p>Little Toto, now that he had an enemy to face, ran barking toward the Lion, and the great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog, when Dorothy, fearing Toto would be killed, and heedless of danger, rushed forward and slapped the Lion upon his nose as hard as she could, while she cried out:</p>
    <p>"Don't you dare to bite Toto!  You ought to be ashamed of yourself, a big beast like you, to bite a poor little dog!"</p>
    <p>"I didn't bite him," said the Lion, as he rubbed his nose with his paw where Dorothy had hit it.</p>

    <h2>Alice in Wonderland</h2>
    <p>'Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: 'don't be angry  about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd  take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet  thing,' Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the  pool, 'and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and  washing her face&mdash;and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse&mdash;and she's  such a capital one for catching mice&mdash;oh, I beg your pardon!' cried  Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she  felt certain it must be really offended. 'We won't talk about her any  more if you'd rather not.'</p>
    <p>'We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his  tail. 'As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always HATED  cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!'</p>
    <p>'I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of  conversation. 'Are you&mdash;are you fond&mdash;of&mdash;of dogs?' The Mouse did not  answer, so Alice went on eagerly: 'There is such a nice little dog near  our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you  know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when  you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts  of things&mdash;I can't remember half of them&mdash;and it belongs to a farmer,  you know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! He  says it kills all the rats and&mdash;oh dear!' cried Alice in a sorrowful  tone, 'I'm afraid I've offended it again!' For the Mouse was swimming  away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in  the pool as it went.</p>
    <p>So she called softly after it, 'Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we  won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!' When the  Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its  face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low  trembling voice, 'Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my  history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'</p>
    <p>It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the  birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo,  a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the  way, and the whole party swam to the shore.</p>
    <p>They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank&mdash;the  birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close  to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.</p>
    <p>The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a  consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural  to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had  known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the  Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, 'I am older than  you, and must know better'; and this Alice would not allow without  knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its  age, there was no more to be said.</p>
    <p>At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,  called out, 'Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'LL soon make you  dry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse  in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt  sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.</p>
    <p>'Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, 'are you all ready? This  is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! "William  the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted  to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much  accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of  Mercia and Northumbria&mdash;"'</p>
    <p>'Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.</p>

    <h2>Around the world in 80 days</h2>
    <p>"To a tailor's."</p>
    <p>Such a visit was, indeed, opportune.  The clothing of both Mr. Fogg and Fix was in rags, as if they had themselves been actively engaged in the contest between Camerfield and Mandiboy.  An hour after, they were once more suitably attired, and with Aouda returned to the International Hotel.</p>
    <p>Passepartout was waiting for his master, armed with half a dozen six-barrelled revolvers.  When he perceived Fix, he knit his brows; but Aouda having, in a few words, told him of their adventure, his countenance resumed its placid expression.  Fix evidently was no longer an enemy, but an ally; he was faithfully keeping his word.</p>
    <p>Dinner over, the coach which was to convey the passengers and their luggage to the station drew up to the door.  As he was getting in, Mr. Fogg said to Fix, "You have not seen this Colonel Proctor again?"</p>
    <p>"No."</p>
    <p>"I will come back to America to find him," said Phileas Fogg calmly. "It would not be right for an Englishman to permit himself to be treated in that way, without retaliating."</p>
    <p>The detective smiled, but did not reply.  It was clear that Mr. Fogg was one of those Englishmen who, while they do not tolerate duelling at home, fight abroad when their honour is attacked.</p>
    <p>At a quarter before six the travellers reached the station, and found the train ready to depart.  As he was about to enter it, Mr. Fogg called a porter, and said to him: "My friend, was there not some trouble to-day in San Francisco?"</p>
    <p>"It was a political meeting, sir," replied the porter.</p>
    <p>"But I thought there was a great deal of disturbance in the streets."</p>
